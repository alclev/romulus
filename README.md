# Romulus

"Romulus" is a  version of our base project "Remus" but with more of an emphasis of performance than programmability. This library is to be used for data collection and other microsecond-scale applications. For our research purposes, we aim to optimize performance and include some application-specific features (eg. dynamic memory permissioning or doorbell batching).
